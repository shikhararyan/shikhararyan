## 💡 What I Actually Build

### 🏥 **Healthcare AI with Regulatory Compliance**
Built HIPAA-compliant medical AI system using **Graph RAG** architecture with automated PII anonymization. Integrated BioBERT for medical entity recognition and intelligent patient-doctor matching based on symptom classification.

**Tech:** Graph RAG, BioBERT, NER, HIPAA compliance, Multi-document processing

### ⚖️ **Legal Document Automation at Scale**
Engineered system generating 150+ page immigration petitions in 45 minutes (vs. 50+ hours manually). Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B on 6,500+ curated examples using QLoRA, achieving 91% accuracy on gap detection vs. expert attorneys.

**Tech:** LangGraph, QLoRA fine-tuning, Gemini 2.5 (data curation), ChromaDB, Long-context generation

### 🎓 **Multimodal Educational AI (10K+ Users)**
First production implementation of Azure SQL vector search in India. Built multimodal RAG system integrating images and videos into AI tutoring sessions, achieving 99.7% uptime for 10,000+ students.

**Tech:** Azure SQL Vector (pioneer), Multimodal RAG, Smart media indexing, Production deployment
